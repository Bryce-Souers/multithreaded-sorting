# Multithreaded Sorting
Benchmarks the effectiveness of using multiple threads to sort random data.
Takes in an array size and then sorts using one thread and then two threads and compares the computation time.

As expected, using multiple threads to sort is faster than using just one thread.

### Getting Started
`$ make` - Compiles each program

`$ make run` - Compiles and runs the program
